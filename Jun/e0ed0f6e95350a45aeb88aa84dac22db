Pretoria – Eskom says it has adequate generating capacity to meet the demand in electricity and therefore no load is taking place at the moment. The power system is expected to be constrained later between 5pm and 9pm as the demand for electricity increases. “As we are currently experiencing cold weather conditions across the country, we urge electricity users to consider energy efficient ways of keeping warm. In winter the electricity demand peaks in the morning and evening as more electricity is used during these times,” said Eskom in a statement. The utility appealed for customers to continue to reduce their electricity usage. Commercial customers can switch off non-essential lights and office equipment such as photocopiers and computers in standby mode after hours. – SAnews.gov.za
