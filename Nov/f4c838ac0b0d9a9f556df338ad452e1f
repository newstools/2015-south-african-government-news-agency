Pretoria – A 34-year-old security officer from Parow in the Western Cape has been arrested during a joint operation of the South African Police Service’s Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) unit and the United States’ Homeland Security. Police spokesperson, Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, said the suspect’s arrest came as a result of an enquiry received from the US Homeland Security via Interpol in January this year. “Further investigations by the Gauteng FCS, which is focusing on crimes against the sexual exploitation of children in the rest of South Africa, pointed them to Cape Town, where the suspect was arrested,” Naidoo said. During the arrest, the suspect’s residence was also searched. Police seized one tablet, a video player, two USBs, a USB video adapter, three cell phones, hundreds of compact discs, hard drive and micro SD card. Naidoo said the working relationship with FCS and other law enforcement agencies from elsewhere in the world has been the primary reason these operations have been successful in arresting perpetrators of child pornography and sexual exploitation of children. “The team is continuously investigating and further arrests cannot be ruled out.” The man will appear before the Bellville Magistrate’s Court tomorrow. - SAnews.gov.za
