Pretoria - President Jacob Zuma will lead a South African delegation of Cabinet Ministers and business leaders to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, from 20-24 January 2015. According to the Presidency, the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting brings together world leaders from business, government, international organizations, academia and civil society in Davos to discuss the global economy. The theme of this year's WEF meeting is The New Global Context, which, according to the Forum organisers, reflects the period of profound political, economic, social and technological change that the world has entered, which has the potential to end the era of economic integration and international partnership that began in 1989. “South Africa will use the opportunity to market the country as an attractive and reliable investment destination as well as a development partner, in the context of the National Development Plan and in celebration of achievements scored since the dawn of freedom in 1994, which brought about a better life for millions more citizens who had been excluded during the period of apartheid colonialism,” said the Presidency. The WEF has invited a large contingent of businesspeople who will interact with global business executives in the pursuit of partnerships and opportunities. The areas of investment that South Africa will be marketing include the following: The President will be accompanied by Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene, Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Minister Jeff Radebe, Health Minister, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel and the South African Brand Ambassador, Dr Zweli Mkhize. – SAnews.gov.za
