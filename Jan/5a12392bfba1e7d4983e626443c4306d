Pretoria - The City of Ekurhuleni’s e-siyakhokha online payment system is up and running with an additional hi-tech function set to address technical glitches experienced by users in December. The municipality said the e-siyakhokha system has been enhanced with the technology that can detect statement integration failure. The enhancement follows challenges experienced in December when some residents could not access their statements after the system failed to detect the statement integration failure. Residents can continue to enjoy the convenience of viewing, paying and downloading their monthly account statements online on https://www.e-siyakhokha.co.za anytime. The online system also enables residents to predate payments (i.e. you can set the system to pay your account on a set date with a set amount if you are on leave or holiday). The system immediately gives you notification of payment, keeps records of your accounts and payments from the time you register to use this method and permits you to query your account online. The due date for payment is fixed and it does not change from month to month, which helps users not to miss payments. “The municipality sincerely apologises for the inconvenience caused to customers who could not view their December statements. “Ratepayers are encouraged to continue utilising the online platform that has been introduced for their convenience,” said Ekurhuleni spokesperson Themba Gadebe. – SAnews.gov.za
