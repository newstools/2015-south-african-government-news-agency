Pretoria - The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has confirmed that it is in the process of acquiring new aircraft for VVIPs. The additional aircraft will be used by President Jacob Zuma, his Deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and other persons identified by the Presidency as envoys. SANDF says the current fleet is not sufficient for Cabinet transportation due to South Africa’s increased international relations commitments. “South Africa’s international relations and commitments, whether multilateral or bilateral, have been increasing greatly in the past two decades. To this end, the South African Air Force (SAAF) must provide aircraft for intercontinental, continental, regional and local flights for engagements and events,” the SANDF said. It said at times, it had to charter aircraft at considerable cost due to this insufficiency. “Confronted by this situation, the SAAF is considering an interim solution that will boost the VVIP fleet while the acquisition process is busy with the ultimate solution.” SANDF said it is also considering the rescheduling of strategic capital acquisition master plan funds to address the interim solution. - SAnews.gov.za
