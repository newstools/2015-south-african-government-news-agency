Pretoria – The community of Thabazimbi, in Limpopo, will on Saturday get an opportunity to interact with Communications Minister Faith Muthambi to get an awareness and education on Government's Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) programme, among other things. Minister Muthambi will lead a Community Outreach and Imbizo Programme at Skelpadnest sports field in Thabazimbi, Limpopo. The purpose of the community outreach programme is to inform and educate members of the community on DTT, as well as directly engage them on the services rendered by the department and its entities. “This is part of our efforts to bring a communications revolution to all corners of our country. We intend to use the upcoming community outreach programme to intensify our consumer awareness campaign and education on DTT that provides a series of exciting opportunities for quality television access, content development and entrepreneurship especially to young South Africans,” said Minister Muthambi.
