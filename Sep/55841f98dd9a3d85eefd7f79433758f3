Pretoria - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Wednesday take questions from Members of Parliament on progress made by government towards achieving the objectives of the National Development Plan (NDP). The NDP, which is at the centre of government efforts, is an overarching programme to eliminate poverty, unemployment and reduce inequality in South Africa by 2030. Other questions that he will answer relate to South Africa's international relations strategy and how it has been effective in promoting peaceful resolution of conflict, while advancing the national interest, including the objectives of the African Agenda. Since the advent of democracy, South Africa has been involved in conflict resolution and post-conflict reconstruction and development initiatives including the DRC, Burundi, Lesotho, South Sudan and Zimbabwe. Pretoria has also been asked to share its experience in the truth and reconciliation and constitutional development processes with the people of Sri Lanka. “Equally, Deputy President Ramaphosa will provide a progress report regarding his recent visits to the Peoples Republic of China and Japan aimed at exploring new and innovative means of growing South Africa's economy,” said the Presidency. Deputy President Ramaphosa recently visited China with a view to study the Chinese model of state-owned enterprises and how South Africa can utilise this model to address challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality. He also visited Japan to reassure investors that South Africa is open for business and encourage foreign direct investment into South Africa. The Deputy President will also outline to MPs what best practice models government is putting into place in the public service to respond to challenges identified by the Public Protector with regard to some government departments and state-owned enterprises. - SAnews.gov.za
