Pretoria - Telecommunication and Postal Services Minister Siyabonga Cwele has met with Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza to discuss how broadband can be used to accelerate service delivery and improve the lives of communities in the province. “We are focused on bringing broadband infrastructure closer to the people to improve service delivery,” Minister Cwele said on Tuesday. The meeting, which was also attended by the Provincial Executive Council, also discussed SA Connect which is the country’s broadband plan. Broadband rollout is central in government's efforts to move South Africa towards developing a dynamic and connected information society as well as a vibrant knowledge economy that is more inclusive and prosperous, as envisaged in the National Development Plan. “International best practices show that it is only through government deliberate action, like rolling out fibre to all communities, that countries can use technology for socio-economic advancement,” Minister Cwele said. The retraining of public servants in the effective use of the technological tools was also discussed at the meeting. The department said the meeting resolved to establish a Provincial Broadband Steering Committee to coordinate all broadband initiatives in the province and cooperate in the conclusion of the high-level provincial broadband rollout plan. “As a province, we are going to work with the office of the Minister. We will cooperate and find the best way in dealing with this assignment,” Premier Mabuza said. – SAnews.gov.za
