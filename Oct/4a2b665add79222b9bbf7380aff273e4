Pretoria - The Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Supervision and Parole Board (CSPB) has rescheduled its meeting for the consideration of placing offender Oscar Pistorius under correctional supervision to 15 October 2015. The session, held at Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre on Friday, was attended by the former paralympian Pistorius and his lawyer. They were informed that the parole board is consulting with the family of the victim. It is expected that the family of Reeva Steenkamp, whom he is serving a five-year sentence for killing, will make a submission on the possible placement of Pistorius under community corrections early next week. The Kgosi Mampuru CSPB session followed the decision of the Parole Review Board to set aside a decision taken on 5 June 2015 to place Pistorius under correctional supervision on 21 August 2015. The Parole Review Board concurred with the concerns expressed by Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha about the premature placement decision. In terms of the Correctional Services Act, offenders sentenced in Terms of Section 276(1)(i) of the Criminal Procedure Act to serve only one-sixth of their sentence in custody before placement consideration should serve the full duration of the mandatory custody period before being considered for placement. â€“ SAnews.gov.za
