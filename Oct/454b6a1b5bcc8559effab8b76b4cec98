Pretoria – The South African Post Office (Sapo) will on Wednesday pay its staff the outstanding portion of their salaries. Post Office employees received 70 percent of their salaries on 23 October after it revealed that it would pay its employees in two batches. “While the current financial position imposes these unintended consequences, the SA Post Office is optimistic that it is only a matter of time before they start seeing improvements on its revenues,” the Post Office said. Sapo is expecting to increase its revenue as it is approaching the festive season, which normally injects a high activity in the mail and parcel business. “There are also other new projects which are at inception such as the digital terrestrial television and other government initiatives. “The Post Office remains grateful to its employees for their understanding during this time and their continuous commitment to providing customers quality services,” the Post Office said. – SAnews.gov.za
